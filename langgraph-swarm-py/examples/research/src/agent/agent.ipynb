Here\\'s my understanding of the project scope:\\n\\n1. User will provide a topic as input\\n2. The application will generate a joke with a clear \"setup:\" and \"punchline:\" format\\n3. This will be a simple Python script without UI or deployment\\n4. The application will use OpenAI\\'s models\\n5. The final output can be a formatted string\\n\\nNow, I\\'ll identify the most relevant URLs from the LangGraph documentation that will help with implementing this project:\\n\\n1. **[How to create a sequence of steps](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/sequence/)** - This is fundamental since we\\'re building a simple sequence: topic -> joke generation -> punchline check.\\n\\n2. **[How to update graph state from nodes](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/state-reducers/)** - This will help us understand how to pass information between the nodes in our graph (topic -> joke -> validation).\\n\\n3. **[How to stream LLM tokens from your graph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/streaming-tokens)** - This could be useful if we want to see the joke being generated in real-time, though it\\'s not a strict requirement.\\n\\nHowever, after reviewing the docs more carefully, I think these URLs would be more relevant:\\n\\n1. **[How to create a sequence of steps](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/sequence/)** - This is still fundamental for our basic chain.\\n\\n2. **[How to update graph state from nodes](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/state-reducers/)** - Still important for state management.\\n\\n3. **[How to define input/output schema for your graph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/input_output_schema/)** - This will help us properly define our input (topic) and output (joke with punchline validation) schemas.\\n\\nLet me prepare a concise scope and links to share with the user.', 'type': 'thinking'}, {'text': 'Based on your requirements, I\\'ve defined the scope and identified the relevant documentation for implementing your LangGraph joke generator application.\\n\\n## Scope:\\n- Create a Python script that takes a topic as input from the user\\n- Implement a three-node LangGraph application (topic input → joke generation → punchline validation)\\n- Use OpenAI\\'s models to generate jokes with a clear \"setup:\" and \"punchline:\" structure\\n- Validate that generated jokes include both parts (setup and punchline)\\n- Return the joke as a formatted string\\n\\n## URLs:\\n1. https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/sequence/ - For creating the basic sequence flow\\n2. https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/state-reducers/ - For implementing state management between nodes\\n3. https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/input_output_schema/ - For defining proper input/output schemas for the graph\\n\\nNow I\\'ll transfer you to the researcher agent who will implement this solution for you.', 'type': 'text'}, {'id': 'toolu_01JdLYx7YGK47wMtQdYzZQ9h', 'input': {}, 'name': 'transfer_to_researcher_agent', 'type': 'tool_use'}]\n",

      "\n",
      "Our [nodes](../../concepts/low_level/#nodes) are just Python functions that read our graph's state and make updates to it. The first argument to this function will always be the state:\n",

      "2. How to use [reducers](../../concepts/low_level/#reducers) to control how state updates are processed.\n",

      "[State](../../concepts/low_level/#state) in LangGraph can be a `TypedDict`, `Pydantic` model, or dataclass. Below we will use `TypedDict`. See [this guide](../../how-tos/state-model) for detail on using Pydantic.\n",
